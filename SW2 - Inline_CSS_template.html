	<p style = "font-family: Arial">Change this font-family to Arial.</p>
	<p style = "font-style: italic">I am not that plain. My font-style is italic.</p>
	<p>Make my font-family into Garamond</p>
	<p>Try to make my font-family into Elvish. It probably won't work. Set another value like fantasy as back-up.</p>
	<p>Make my font-size xx-large</p>
	<p>And make my font-size 2cm</p>
	<p>How about you increase my font-size to 180%</p>
	<p>Make my font-weight 900</p>
	<p>And make my font-weight light</p>
	<p>Make me centered text</p>
	<p>And align me to the right.</p>
	<p>I'm irrelevant. Use text-decoration to put a line through me.</p>
	<p>I don't like the text above me. Make an overline using text-decoration</p>
	<p>Increase my letter spacing to 6px</p>
	<p>I don't really like the others. Give me some space by making my margin 50px.</p>
	<p>Make me red using rgb values</p>
	<p>Make me blue using hex values.</p>
	<p>I want to shout. Make my text uppercase using text-transform</p>
	<p>I want my color to be white, my background-color black. I want my font-family to be Verdana with a backup monospace. I want to be font-weighted as bold and increase my size to 200%. I want to be centered on the page and I also want to be underlined. Bow down to me.</p>
	<p>Can you make me into something even more elaborate than the one before me?</p>
